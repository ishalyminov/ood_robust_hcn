Following tricks are enabled:
* KL cost annealing

* Word dropout

  ```word_dropout_rate``` is the % of decoder input words masked with unknown tags, in order to weaken the decoder and force it relying on encoder

* Concatenating latent vector (z) into decoder inputs

G: this is the worst movie ever made the film i have ever seen in the <end>
------------
I: the 60´s is a well balanced mini series between historical facts and a good plot

D: <start> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> balanced <unk> <unk> <unk> historical <unk> <unk> a <unk> plot

O: the movie is one of the most interesting and the actors and a great cast <end>
------------
I: i love this film and i think it is one of the best films

O: i love this movie and i found it was a fan of the best films <end>
------------
I: this movie is a waste of time and there is no point to watch it

O: this movie is a complete waste of time to this movie and don't miss it <end>

Model saved in file: ./saved/vrae.ckpt
```
where:
* I is the encoder input

* D is the decoder input (if 90% word dropout is set, then about 9 out of 10 words are unknown)

* O is the decoder output with regards to encoder input I

* G is random text generation, replacing the latent vector (z) by unit gaussian

``` python test.py ```
```
Loading trained model ...
I: i love this firm and it is beyond my expectation

O: i watched this movie because it was very much more than it at all costs <end>
------------
I: i want to watch this movie again because it is so interesting

O: i can to say that this is no reason why this movie was so bad <end>
------------
I: the time taken to develop the characters is quite long

O: the other people are so many people like this is the film to see it <end>
------------
I: is there any point to make a bad movie like this

O: to watch this film you have a lot but it's a good movie that is <end>
------------
I: sorry but there is no point to watch this movie again

O: movie but it was so bad i mean the people have seen this movie again <end>
------------
I: to be honest this movie is not worth my time and money

O: don't bother with this movie is so bad if you're on imdb com and enjoy <end>
